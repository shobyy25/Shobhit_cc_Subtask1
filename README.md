Name: Shobhit<br>
Roll No.: 220101093 <br> 
Branch: CSE <br>
Hello and welcome to my repository for subtask 1 of open source module. I am from Gurgaon, Haryana and my hobbies include watching shows and movies, dancing, playing volleyball and football and much more. One thing I like about myself is that after coming to college I have developed a keen interest in coding, especially in CP. But I would love to explore other modules as well. <br>

One of them being open source. I would like to join open source as it would help me build my porfolio, enhance my problem solving skills, and make a meaningful impact on widely used software. Collaborating with talented individuals would help me to expand my network and foster personal growth. Also, if I get a chance to be selected in GSoC'24, I would be very grateful to these tasks.
